        <p>A little while after settling into our new flat in London, we popped across the channel to Belgium.</p>
<p><img src="/belgium/belgium1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Eurostar was fantastic – so easy and relaxing, and we were in Brussels in around 2 hours. As well as visiting this great little country, I also wanted to visit my host family who I stayed with for a year in 2003.
We spent a few days in Brussels, where I tried to act as guide and show Kylie the sights, sounds, and especially, tastes of the city.</p>
<p><img src="/belgium/belgium2.jpg" alt="">
Highlights of Brussels for us included the Tintin museum, the royal palace, la grand place (Brussels’ central square), the great architecture around the city, and the <a href="https://www.cantillon.be/?lang=en">Cantillon Brewery</a></p>

<p>This brewery was really interesting and also had the advantage of being close to the gare du nord (from where you take the eurostar). They don’t offer brewery tours as such; instead you’re given some key info, and a detailed pamphlet, and you can wander around the brewery at your leisure. This is an old family brewery which makes a selection of lambic beers. Lambic beer is produced by  spontaneous fermentation; it is exposed to wild yeasts and bacteria in the air. The attic of the brewery therefore has slats which can be opened or closed depending on the weather, temperature, and its possible effects on the beer.  Included in the price of admission (6 euros) is a welcome glass of beer. Highly recommend visiting this brewery for an unique insight into traditional brewing methods, and the beer is tasty too.</p>

<p>It was good to use my rusty French, although a little frustrating at things I kept forgetting.</p>
<p>Next stop was Louvain-la-Neuve, and the lovely Kreit family. Louvain-la-Neuve, or LLN to the locals, was built relatively recently – around 40 years ago. The story goes that both French-speaking Belgians (Walloons) and Dutch-speaking Belgians (Flemish) once attended the Catholic University of Leuven/Louvain together – in the Flemish region of the country. Disagreements between the two groups led to the Walloons creating their own version of Leuven/Louvain, hence ‘Louvain-la-Neuve’ (‘the new Louvain’), and their own university as well.</p>
<p>During my time in LLN in 2003 it was very noticeably a student town, and it felt quite deserted in the summer months. In 2012 however a lot had changed. There is now a brand new shopping complex. More people, families especially, have been moving to the town, and there was a lot of life in the town, although the middle of summer (which had previously felt deserted as the students went home or in search of summer work elsewhere).</p>
<p>In LLN we stayed with my host parents Véronique and Jean-François, and managed to see host sisters Marguerite and Evelyne, as well as recent addition to family, Evelyne’s daughter Lily. It was great to catch up with them all – although my host parents visited NZ a few years ago, I hadn’t seen the others for 9 years!</p>

<p>From LLN we headed back to Brussels, where we met up with Monique, a friend from NZ who was living in Brussels at the time. Monique kindly let us stay in her studio in Brussels, took us to the reputedly best ‘friterie’ (fries shop) in the city (Antoine’s), and gave us some local tips.</p>

We took some day trips to Leuven and Ghent in the Flemish region, enjoying the great architecture, and local tastes.</p>
