 At the end of January I began the mammoth journey back to NZ for a visit. My flight from Heathrow was delayed which meant a rush to transfer in Singapore. Although I made it, sadly my bag did not until later the following day. I now appreciate the wisdom in packing a change of clothes in your carry-on.

Auckland welcomed me home with stunning weather
It had been two years since we left the country so it was nice to be seeing friends and family again. I spent time in Wellington, Palmerston North, New Plymouth and a brief stop in Auckland. I really enjoyed catching up with friends and family, and making the most of all the things I miss about NZ while living in London.

I'm sure anyone who has spent a long time living away from their 'home' country and returns for a visit can relate to the slightly surreal feeling I experienced. Although Wellington still sort of felt like 'home,' I have a different life in such a different place now. Some things are the same but many have changed. So it was with mixed feelings that I jumped back on the first of my three flights and 26+ hour journey back to my second 'home.'
