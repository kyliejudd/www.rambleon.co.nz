From Luang Prabang, we took a hair-raising minivan ride to Vang Vieng. I think our driver thought he was playing Gran Turismo or something, managing to shave an hour or so off the very windy and hilly journey but leaving us all a little queasy and glad to reach our destination. Along the way, we did stop to admire the scenery from a beautiful viewpoint amongst the mountains – stunning scenery, although not very clear due to the haze from rice paddy burning.

Vang Vieng is a huge tourism spot in Laos, with many coming here and venturing little elsewhere in Laos. Most go floating down the Nam Song river in giant tractor inner tubes, and while this sounds idyllic enough, there is also quite the party, booze and drug scene to go along with it. Restaurants play endless episodes of Friends or The Family Guy as people recover from their hangovers and almost all seem to offer some form of ‘happy’ pizza, shake, or whatever you want. In this sense, it seems a completely different world from the rest of conservative Laos.
