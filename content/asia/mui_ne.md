Next stop was some more beach time. We had heard that Mui Ne was a little less touristy than Nha Trang and so decided to try there. There turned out to be, however, quite an abundance of Russian tourists and resorts all along the strip of beach. The restaurants left a lot to be desired, unless you were prepared to fork out a decent amount for some seafood. We did manage to find a nice local food stall though, and enjoyed some good oleâ€™ pho (noodle soup) for a fraction of the cost.
The main road along the beach was stiflingly hot at the time, but in our hotel high in the dunes, we were very glad of the breeze that made its way to us. We spent a few days enjoying a nice hotel, view, and a little bit of the beach, and then decided to move on.
