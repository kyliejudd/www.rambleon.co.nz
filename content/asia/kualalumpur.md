We had just two days in Malaysia’s capital KL. During this time we checked out Jalan Alor – a street packed full of food stalls and restaurants – we had some good satay and some drunken chicken (the latter being not very exciting actually).

 We got our obligatory shot of the Petronas twin towers, and had a look around the mall in the bottom (Suria KLCC). We also visited Merdeka Square (a big open square where Malaysian independence was declared in 1957) and Masjid Jamek (an impressive mosque built in 1907).
