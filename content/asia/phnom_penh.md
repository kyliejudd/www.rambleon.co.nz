Arriving into bustling Phnom Penh was a shock to the system after chilled out Kratie and Si Phan Don. We adjusted to the new pace and noise however, and enjoyed exploring the city.

 The Royal Palace and the Silver Pagoda were great to see. The bits we were allowed to see in the palace weren’t as lavish as you might have expected. The Silver Pagoda however and its multitude of heavily adorned Buddha images were quite extravagant.

 We also visited the Killing Fields and S-21; the former was one of many places where ‘enemies’ to the Khmer Rouge were taken to be executed; while the latter was used as a prison during the same time. Both of these museums were harrowing – especially as you remind yourself that all of these horrible events took place a mere few decades ago.

We were surprised at the amount of NGOs in Phnom Penh (actually, in the rest of Cambodia as well). From restaurants or cafes offering employment and training to women previously in the sex industry, or former street kids, to retail shops selling products made by people with disabilities, or illnesses. The amount of organisations out there to help people disadvantaged in some way and who don’t receive the support they need from the government is amazing. Being able to patronise these businesses also makes you feel like you’re helping in some way, while sipping on your coffee or buying a t-shirt. Interestingly however, talking to an NGO worker a few weeks later he told us that around 10% of the NGOs working in Cambodia left last year, as they were sick of dealing with the corruption prevalent at all levels of organisations and government departments.

It was nice wandering around the waterfront, and easy to navigate central Phnom Penh on foot.

As we were in Phnom Penh, the rainy season was just beginning, and it was our first introduction to the impressive downpours and pandemonium this creates in the city. A few times we were caught out and had to shelter inside wherever was close.
