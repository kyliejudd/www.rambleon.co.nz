 From Hanoi we flew down to Bangkok for the last leg of our South East Asia journey. Having visited Bangkok a few years ago and seen some of the key sights, such as the Grand Palace, we took a relaxed attitude towards sightseeing this time round.

We did visit the National Museum however, which was quite good and informative. Itâ€™s set in the former grounds of the 18th Century Wang Na Palace so the buildings themselves are also beautiful. We found the Thai history gallery the most interesting, spending less time on the sections dedicated to King worship.

Having experienced so much more of Asia this time round, Bangkok seemed far less daunting, and much more tame than the first time we visited.

While in Bangkok, we spent a bit of time in some of the massive, beautifully air-conditioned malls. The extravagance of some malls is simply astounding; one we visited had an actual Lamborghini dealership, with three cars on display.

We arranged a trip to the island of Koh Tao to do some diving (see next post), and then returned to Bangkok for a few days before flying out. For our second stint, we again met up with Mike and Torika, and enjoyed spending time shopping and eating together.
