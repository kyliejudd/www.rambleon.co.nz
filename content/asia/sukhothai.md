From Ayutthaya we travelled north to Sukhothai, another former capital of Thailand, built in the 13th century. The old city of Sukhothai is around 12km from the new city, and is full of an impressive number of ruins wats and monuments, which are more intact than those in Ayutthaya. We rented bikes to get around the old city and enjoyed biking around from wat to wat - we managed to see quite a bit. Wat Mahathat is one of the most famous ones, as it is the largest, and quite beautiful. There were also wats on little islands, some of which you had to reach by footbridge. We also visited Wat Si Chum which contains a massive seated Buddha – at a guess around 10m high, it’s impressive and a little intimidating.
