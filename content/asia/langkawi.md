From Penang, we took a ferry across to Langkawi for some quality beach time. The ferry was positively Antarctic. I’ve never understood why sometimes the air-conditioning is so cold, it has everyone reaching for extra layers and shivering throughout the trip – surely this is a sure sign it’s a little too cold?

Once we arrived in Langkawi, however, the temperature was nice and toasty. We stayed at Zackry’s Guest House in Pantai Tengah – a great little place, comfortable, with a really good atmosphere. Langkawi is duty free so alcohol is significantly cheaper than on the mainland. Our hostel had a bar and a can of beer was a mere 3 Ringgit (approx. NZ$1.20). So we spent a bit of time chatting to other fellow travellers, sharing stories and advice over beers. With lots of resorts in the area, it was probably the first time we’ve seen quite so many upmarket tourists in our travels.

We spent a bit of time relaxing on the beach just down the road, although had to wait until late afternoon, when it wasn’t quite so scorching.

One day we rented a little scooter for an amazing 30 Ringgit and had great fun zooming around the place – once we’d got the hang of things. We went to the langkawi cable car, which was great. Not super cheap, at 30 Ringgit each, but it goes up surprisingly high, with a stop halfway up and then several viewing platforms including a hanging bridge right at the top. Fantastic view across the island.

All in all we had a great few days relaxing and working on our tans a little bit. Even I’m starting to look a little less transparent!
