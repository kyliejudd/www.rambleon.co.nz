Our next stop was Penang, a large island off the west coast of the Malaysian peninsular. We stayed at really nice backpackers, Cocoa Mews. Located in Little India, it was handy, comfortable and the staff were helpful with recommendations of places to go and things to see. Penang is also quite easy to get around, with a good bus system and a free shuttle service around the core heritage zone.

Staying in Little India was a great experience in itself, filled with lots of yummy restaurants serving naan and chicken straight from the tandoor, as well as biryani. Walking through Little India, you pass stops blaring out the latest Bollywood hits, saree shops, hindu temples, as well as mosques, and street vendors selling the best samosas, for only 20 cents NZ apiece.


We visited the Blue Mansion – the former house of prominent Penang businessman Chong Fat Tzee. Painted a stunning blue colour on the outside, it was an impressive place full of stories – and as with the Baba Nyonya house in Melaka, all the different designs and patterns in the wood and steel work all have a specific meaning (i.e. fish for prosperity etcetera). Even the layout and location of certain elements of the house have a certain significance; the house must be centered around the point of most Qi, and the water in the shallow pool in the central courtyard must not be still but must flow in a certain direction. It was fascinating to learn these sorts of things. The blue mansion has also been used in several films, such as Indochine, where it was passed off as Vietnamese. We also visited the Penang Peranakan Heritage House – another beautiful example of the Peranakan/Baba-Nyonya culture and heritage.

The Kek Lok Si temple just out of Penang, is the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia, and houses a massive statue of Buddha and a pagoda decorated with an astounding number of Buddha images. We arrived early in the morning, before it got too hot, and discovered you can in fact take a cable car up the hill to the site of the temple.

Recommended by the locals, we also bussed out to Batu Ferringhi, a beach resort area and a nice place to spend a few hours with a beer.
