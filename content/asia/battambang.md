We arrived in Battambang from Phnom Penh and after being dropped at the bus stop we turned up at our guesthouse, named ‘bus stop’ – very confusing. An Australian-owned place that advertises “the coldest beer in town” – what is it with Australians and their beers needing to be the coldest?

The next day we turned up at the bamboo train locally known as a norry, BattamBang is one of the only places left in Cambodia that has these. During the 80’s and 90’s there were hundreds if not thousands of these things whizzing around the country. Of course before the Khmer rouge shutdown the railways in the 70’s these tracks were for actual trains and as the country recovers and repairs the seriously neglected tracks the bamboo trains become more scarce. In construction they are simply a steel frame sitting on steel wheels and covered with a bamboo base powered by what seems to be a go cart or scooter engine, which propels them down the tracks at speeds up to 40 km/h

 40 km/h doesn’t seem that fast but with the low centre of gravity, the lack of suspension, sound deadening, walls, and by the looks of it nothing but a bit of wood for brakes it soon gets more exciting than you’d expect.

When another “train” is met coming the other way they both stop and one helps the other to lift their train off the tracks drives past and then puts it back on again.

At the other end of the track we arrived at a small village full of eager locals for you to get out of the heat and enjoy a drink. Children create animals from flax and proudly show you around their village (of course for a small fee)

When we got back we found an evening cooking class which involved a market tour, which along with the normal fare of meat/veges/ fruit also had fried crickets and cockroaches.
We sat in the kitchen of a family run restaurant and chopped and bashed under the supervision of the husband, while the wife and children attended to the patrons. We created a fish amok which is a yellow fish curry that is steamed in banana leaves, a sour soup and popular Lok Lak which is diced beef done with black ground pepper topped with a fried egg served with rice.
It was nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of Phnom Penh and see local life that doesn’t revolve around tourism.

The next day we left for Siem Reap.
