During our Cambodia trip, we had been thinking; “I wonder where all the tourists are.” Well it turns out they all seem to be in Siem Reap. With the temples of the Angkor Wat archaeological park and the infamous pub street, I don’t think we had seen so many tourists since……well maybe ever.

The town itself has obviously benefitted from the crowds and the dollars they bring with them, with an attractive tree lined river side and a number of NGO-run restaurants and shops. Having such a large tourist population however has resulted in an even larger population of tuk tuks, and you really get sick of being asked for one every two steps. That said, we enjoyed hanging out in Siem Reap, it was an easy town to get around (we used bikes from our hotel) and it was just a nice place to be with a nice atmosphere.

While in Siem Reap, we of course went to Angkor Wat, spending about two and a half days visiting different temples. There were certainly some stunning ones; from the majestic Angkor Wat to jungle-covered Ta Prohm. Many of the temples have international teams working to restore or preserve certain sections, so often some areas were closed off.

We soon found out that clambering around and up and down temples in the heat is quite exhausting. The park itself covers a huge area, and there are different routes you can do. We did both the small and the big circuit, although missed the odd temple, and then went back to spots we had missed. Being at Angkor Wat for sunrise is a popular thing to do, so we thought we’d do that too. Unfortunately this meant leaving our hotel at the ungodly hour of 5am. The sunrise was nice, and we got some good shots, although I’m not sure I’d do it again.

Being the rainy season, our temple visits or plans for visiting sites around the city were affected a little by sudden downpours. We saw people biking between temples who were caught out in the rain and drenched in seconds – didn’t look very pleasant, although at least you cool down. Luckily we had arranged a tuk tuk through our hotel which took us from temple to temple, and our driver met us with icy cold water after each temple. While we enjoyed visiting these amazing archaeological sites, at the end of Siem Reap, we were a bit templed-out.
