 German Alpine Road part 2: Salzburg, Hitler's Eagles Nest, Konigssee, Munich
On the road again, in the trusty Citroen, we headed to Salzburg.

We took the cable car up to the top of the hill which is home to the Hohensalzburg Fortress. Unfortunately the day was quite foggy, so the view out over the town wasn't what it could have been. However it was still an interesting visit, with an abundance of medieval weapons, and historical stories (none of which I can remember now).

We also took time to wander around the picturesque cobbled streets, with their ornate façades, clocks and shop signs. Then off we went in search of some dinner, tracking down a little pub called Bärenwirt Seit 1663. Here we were presented with a veritable feast: the largest dumplings I've ever seen, and copious amounts of pork - naturally all accompanied by fantastic beer served in ceramic steins.

Soon the large table near us filled up with what appeared to be a work celebration of some sort. To great fanfare, a large wooden barrel of beer was brought out and tapped right there and then. A great little pub - highly recommended!

We popped over the border to Germany to Bad Reichenhall (cheaper accommodation), before setting out for Hitler's Eagles Nest the following day. I was surprised by quite how commercial this site has become. You queue for giant elevators transporting you up the mountain and suddenly you find yourself in a busy restaurant which was once a retreat for Hitler and his guests. The location was pretty amazing though, right on the border of Austria and Germany and, being so high up, you felt like you were on the top of the world. Unfortunately much of the presumably fantastic view was shrouded in fog again.

A short drive away was Königssee (translated as 'the King's lake' I believe). Surrounded by huge mountains on all sides, with incredibly clear water, the lake was stunning. No motor boats are allowed, meaning it was also very peaceful. As per tradition, once our electric-powered boat was in the middle of the lake, one of the crew took out a trumpet and played a few notes, showing off the echo off the mountains.

We hopped off on the first stop and explored around the little church and paths, before heading for a bite to eat, at the 'restaurant' of the one person with a license to fish on the lake. Here there was a simple wooden building and sheds filled with smoked fish dangling everywhere. We each ordered a fish, a piece of simple rye bread, and a beer. Simple, but packed full of flavour and delicious! A nice end to our trip.

We made our way to Munich, where Kylie and I were catching our flight from, leaving James and Susie to continue their road trip adventure. Before we left, we had time to stop off at a great brewery on the outskirts of Munich, and enjoy some great beer and pretzels. I believe it was Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan, Germany's oldest brewery, and conveniently close to the airport.
