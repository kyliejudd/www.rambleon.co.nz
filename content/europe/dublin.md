 In June 2014, we went visited Dublin for a couple of days. First impressions were great as we were greeted by the most friendly border control worker I've ever come across. This theme continued during our stay, coming across very accommodating and helpful people.

We visited The Little Museum of Dublin, being led through this history of this fascinating city by a knowledgeable guide. Having not learnt that much about the history of Ireland before, I found it all really interesting - the bits I could understand that is, as I struggled a little with the guide's accent from time to time. The Kilmainham Gaol offered another interesting glimpse into Dublin's history.

Taking a break in the grounds of Trinity College
During out time there, we naturally had to visit the home of one of the city's most famous exports, Guinness. The Guinness factory was quite fun, with a bit of history, and a free pint at the end. Something that has stuck with me to this day was being taught how to drink a Guinness 'properly.' Placebo effect perhaps, but it really did seem to taste that much better in Ireland itself, and drunk using the proper technique.

The reason we were in Dublin at that specific time was to go along to a Jack White concert, one of Kylie's favourite artists. Unfortunately the weather turned on us a bit and it was decidedly damp, but nevertheless enjoyable.

 All in all we found Dublin to be really nice place to go for a few days - easy to get around, lovely people, and some great food as well.
