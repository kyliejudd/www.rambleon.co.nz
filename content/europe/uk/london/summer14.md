I've said it more than once, but London really is like a different world in the summer. People are noticeably happier, you can really make the most of all the wonderful parks and markets, and the evenings are long - making it seem as though there are so many more hours in the day.

The summer of 2014 was a stunner. I remember many a weekday evening or weekend day spent enjoying the sun on our roof terrace, normally around the bbq.

Unfortunately in many ways London is not built for warm weather, and neither commuting nor working in AC-free offices was much fun!

Here's a few photos from that time.
