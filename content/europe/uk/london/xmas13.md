The weeks leading up to Xmas in London are an odd mixture of joy and madness,The lights and trees go up, the scent of mulled wine is wafting down the streets, the pubs are full of merry people drinking by open fires.On one hand, things are winding down at work and people are looking forward to getting out of town.On the other hand, the lack of planning and the massive sales that have been running since black Friday are mixing into a shopping tornado of madness. Then on Xmas day everyone has gone out to see family or gone on holiday, it's like a scene from a movie, collect supplies and evacuate.
While there isn't much to say about Xmas day 2013 except that the food and company were wonderful, I did manage to get in a morning bike ride into London central and try and get some snaps of London after the storm had passed.
