 In April, we spent a weekend in charming Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace. We wandered around the cute wee city centre with its distinctive architecture, had some fish and chips, and even saw Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company.

 The main reason for our visit however was for me to participate in the Shakespeare half marathon. It was a great race. In comparison to the other half I had done, where around only 20 people took part, and I managed to get lost, this race seemed huge, and very well organised. 

The day of the race, Kylie made the most of the traditional full English breakfast served up at our bed and breakfast, while I managed my specifically requested peanut butter toast.

Kylie waited to cheer me on during our first lap of the village centre, and even managed to snap a pic (already a success compared to the Hutt Valley half). After that we headed out into the countryside, passing through small settlements before arriving back into Stratford itself.

 It was a great atmosphere, with lots of supporters, including families and small children cheering everyone on, and a few unusual outfits, either for charity or for what seemed to be no reason at all. I'm not much of a speed freak, but was glad to improve on my previous time by around 15 minutes.

 After the race, we enjoyed a well deserved pub lunch before heading back to London.
