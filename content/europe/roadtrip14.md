 In September 2014 we flew over to Budapest to join NZ friends James and Susie for part of their European road trip.

The weather in Budapest was amazingly balmy and we enjoyed strolling around this compact city. We wandered alongside the Danube, looking at the vast Parliament buildings, and taking in the Shoes on the Danube Memorial, shoes fashioned of steel in memory of the Jews who were shot into the river during World War II.

We also visited the Jewish Quarter, and saw the Great Synagogue and the Jewish Museum. The details inside the synagogue were stunning.

We clamboured up the hill to the Fisherman's Bastion, and took in the fantastic views across the city.

Before leaving Budapest, we made sure to visit one of the famous public thermal baths. We chose the Széchenyi Baths, and spent a long time bobbing about in the water. The building housing the baths was stunning - the essence of opulence.

After a couple of days there, we hit the road, headed for Austria and then through to Munich along the incredibly picturesque German Alpine Road. Next stop: Vienna!

The apartment we were staying at in Vienna had bicycles we could use. So the first afternoon we were there, off we headed on the bikes, on a scenic route into town alongside a canal. Unfortunately they were in various states of disrepair and it actually proved to be a bit more challenging than expected. Nevertheless, we had a good time on our wee adventure and managed to get a feel for the city, as well as enjoying some local beer and some massive schnitzel.

 Undeterred by our experience, we decided to book a bike tour of the city, and spent a morning cycling around and learning a bit about Viennese history, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and marvelling at the impressive architecture around the city, both modern buildings, like those by the famous Hundertwasser, and distinctly older historical buidings.

Vienna has quite a reputation for its café culture, where, in many cases it's still perfectly acceptable to smoke inside café. So we made sure to check out one of the traditional, and rather opulent, options in town, where we also tried Austria's famous Sachertorte, a orangey chocolate cake.

While in Vienna, we also visited Riesenrad, the famous ferris wheel featured in the The Third Man film. The wooden compartments felt rather rickety but did offer great views over the theme park below, and part of the city.

There certainly seemed to be quite a lot of wealth in Vienna, but I also felt like something about it, a certain artistic streak, or edginess, reminded me of Berlin.

After Vienna, we continued on our journey through Austria. During the trip through to Salzburg we enjoyed watching the gentle green hills and very stereotypically Bavarian houses roll past. En route, we also chanced upon an amazing abbey, I believe it was the Melk Abbey. We managed to sneak a peek through a side door and the interior was simply stunning - I don't think I've ever seen such extravagance.
